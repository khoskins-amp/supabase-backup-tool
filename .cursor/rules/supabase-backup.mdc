# Supabase Backup Tool Guidelines

When working on backup functionality:

## Database Operations
- Use Drizzle ORM with SQLite for local storage
- Encrypt sensitive credentials using Node.js crypto
- Implement backup verification and integrity checks
- Follow tRPC patterns for backup API endpoints

## CLI Integration
- Use child_process for Supabase CLI commands
- Parse CLI output safely with proper error handling
- Implement progress tracking for long-running operations

## File Management
- Organize backups in structured directories
- Implement retention policies and cleanup
- Use compression for backup files
- Validate backup integrity after creation

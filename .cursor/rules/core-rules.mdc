# Core Development Principles

You are working on a modern, type-safe, full-stack React project using:
- **TanStack Start** (SSR/SSG meta-framework)
- **TanStack Router** (file-based routing)
- **TailwindCSS v4+** with @theme directive
- **shadcn/ui** components
- **tRPC** for type-safe APIs
- **TanStack Query** for data fetching
- **TypeScript** (required for all code)

## Core Rules
- Type safety is paramount - never use `any`
- Always use `pnpm`
- Use file-based routing conventions
- Prefer composition over inheritance
- Follow TailwindCSS v4 CSS-first configuration
- Use shadcn/ui primitives, don't modify them directly


- Always use tRPC + TanStack Query integration patterns
